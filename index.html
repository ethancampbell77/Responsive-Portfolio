    <img class="mypic" src="../Responsive-Portfolio/assets/images/me-pic.jpg" height="200px" width="200px" alt="Ethan Campbell">
    <p>My name is Ethan. I currently reside in Dover, NH - nestled somewhere between Boston, MA and Portland, ME.  I’m a recovering New Yorker, though I’ve also called Los Angeles home for a spell.  I have a background in Photo Production, Project Management and Digital Asset Management working with stellar brands like Amazon.com, Converse/Nike and The Children’s Place. I’m currently signed on for new adventures learning and writing computer languages, as well as a starting a new role as a Marketing and Social Media Manager. I try to take time to hang out with my wife, dog and guitars where I can find it. Check out my portfolio to see how all that is going.</p>
